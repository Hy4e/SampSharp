# SampSharp-GameMode
Police Pursuit SA:MP GameMode written in C# using plugin SampSharp.

Hi. This GameMode was supposed to be Police Pursuit / CopChase but unfortunely due to unknown bug (for now) I couldn't finish it.
It was supposed to be open source anyway for anyone to learn how to use the SampSharp plugin.
You can learn more about S# here: https://sampsharp.net/

# SampSharp-GameMode
Police Pursuit SA:MP GameMode written in C# using plugin SampSharp.

Hi. This GameMode was supposed to be Police Pursuit / CopChase but unfortunely due to unknown bug (for now) I couldn't finish it.
It was supposed to be open source anyway for anyone to learn how to use the SampSharp plugin.
You can learn more about S# here: https://sampsharp.net/

Credits:
- Ikkentim for creating such amazing thing as SampSharp is.
- SampSharp Slack Team for help, thank u guys!

Note 22.11.2020:
Please consider using MS EF (Microsoft Entity Framework) for connecting with your MySql database.
The sample code here is good snippet for totally beggining, but the framework will save lots of your time and work.
I may update this project in the next year as I get some time.
